# Portfolio Reflection – CS 340

Throughout this course, I focused on writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs by separating responsibilities and reusing code where possible. A key example is the CRUD Python module developed in Project One and reused in Project Two to connect the dashboard widgets to the MongoDB database. By isolating database operations into a single module, I kept the dashboard logic clean and focused on user interaction rather than database details. This approach made the application easier to debug, update, and extend. In the future, this CRUD module could be reused for other dashboards or applications that require database connectivity, reducing development time and improving consistency across projects.

When approaching problems as a computer scientist, I emphasized understanding the client’s requirements before implementing a solution. For the database and dashboard requirements requested by Grazioso Salvare, I carefully analyzed how the data needed to be filtered, displayed, and interacted with by end users. This project required more planning and system-level thinking than many previous assignments, as it involved integrating multiple components rather than solving a single isolated problem. Going forward, I would continue using strategies such as breaking problems into smaller components, validating requirements early, and designing flexible data structures to meet evolving client needs.

Computer scientists play a critical role in helping organizations make better decisions by transforming raw data into meaningful, usable tools. This matters because well-designed software systems improve efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility of information. My work on this project demonstrates how a thoughtfully designed database and interactive dashboard can help a company like Grazioso Salvare quickly access and analyze data to support operational decisions. By providing reliable, scalable, and user-friendly solutions, computer scientists enable organizations to work more effectively and adapt to changing demands.
